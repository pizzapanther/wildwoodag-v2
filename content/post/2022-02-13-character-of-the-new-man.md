<p data-block-key="qwnx8">&quot;Therefore, put to death your members which are on the earth…put off all these:<br/>anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth.&quot;<br/><b>Col. 3:5-8</b></p><p data-block-key="7a7kf"></p><p data-block-key="9n85s">The character of the ‘new man’ stands in clear contrast to the ‘old man’! We, in our old lives, lived like the rest of the lost and dying world. The things of this world were more important! Now, we must liver differently, or the watching world will reject the very faith we claim to have!</p>
