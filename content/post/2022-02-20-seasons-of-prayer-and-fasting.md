<p data-block-key="cmfxz">…the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wicked, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke…<br/><b>Isaiah 58:6</b></p><p data-block-key="12ncm"></p><p data-block-key="fvkqj">Seasons of prayer and fasting can be physically and spiritually productive and life changing! Just read the verse about all that is accomplished: loose bonds, ease burdens, free the oppressed, break the yoke… Wow!</p>
