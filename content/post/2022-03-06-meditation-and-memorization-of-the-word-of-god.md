Psalm 119:11 says, &quot;Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.&quot;



During this time when the world seems turned upside down, and every where we turn we see conflict, it is essential that we take the time, as Bill Johnson says, &quot;to meditate on the Word and give ourselves every opportunity to remember what is true.&quot; The meditation and memorization of the Word of God is a spiritual discipline that needs revival in our lives!
