And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. 1 Cor. 13:13

An old favorite comic strip, Peanuts, written by Charles Schulz offered a lot more than laughter. Time and again I found solid theology written by the comedian cartoonist. A favorite one was Lucy and Linus: Lucy says &quot;You a doctor! Ha! That’s a big laugh! You could never be a doctor! You know why? Because you don’t love mankind, that’s why!&quot; Linus responds &quot;I LOVE MANKIND… IT&#x27;S PEOPLE I CAN’T STAND!&quot;

When you have a moment, read all of 1 Cor. chapter 13. And remember, we won’t be any good as a &#x27;clanging cymbal&#x27;. A genuine demonstration of agape love is what moves a lost and dying world.
