<p data-block-key="cb4q7">And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19</p><p data-block-key="4agte">Allow me to share a little more Charles Schulz theology with you today.  In one of his Peanuts comic strips, Snoopy looks at his water dish, and says “Empty! And I’m dying of thirst!” Then he picks up the dish in his mouth and for several squares is running over to the water faucet where he waits, but nothing comes out. Then, without notice, it starts raining, then raining harder. Snoopy takes the dish, sets it down, gets a drink and in the last square he is lying on his dog house saying &quot;That’s one I’m going to have to think about for a while.&quot;</p><p data-block-key="29fvm">We are like that sometimes; God provides in so many ways and we are left in awe and wonder. </p>
