…they led Him away,… And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him… Luke 23:26, 33

Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. Lk. 23:44-45

It was a sad, dark day. Perhaps the saddest in human history. Doubtless it was a Friday of sorrow and pain, of weeping and broken hearts.

Yes, it was Friday: but Sunday is on the way!

Up until that point, no one really understood. No one had the faith to believe what Christ said was necessary, and what would happen. This day had pain and suffering enough to go around.

<b>Ah, but Sunday. Sunday is on the way!</b>
