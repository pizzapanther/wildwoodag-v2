<p data-block-key="cxebt">That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. Philippians 3:10-11</p><p data-block-key="1ul58"></p><p data-block-key="f64fe">When we baptize a person in water, fully immersed in the water, they are identifying with the DEATH, BURIAL AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST. We should know the power of His resurrection. And remember that the empty tomb says it all!</p>
