<p data-block-key="qh8l0">Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, James 5:13-15a </p><p data-block-key="bm2bd">It is not overstated to say that PRAYER changes everything! Verse 16 says that &quot;the effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.&quot;</p><p data-block-key="6lob2">Once again, this coming Friday and Saturday, April 29-30, from noon until noon, we will have constant prayer in the sanctuary. Twenty-four hours of prayer for the nation, for the community and for the church family. The sign-up sheet is on the table in the foyer.  </p>
