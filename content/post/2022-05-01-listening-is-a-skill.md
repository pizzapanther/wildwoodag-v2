<p>Psalm 34:11 - Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</p><p>Listening is a skill! Quite frankly it is one that many are lacking. Oftentimes, when we do not listen well to others in our lives, we lack the ability to listen when the Lord desires to speak with us.</p><p>Some of the instruction I gave for those participating in the twenty-four hours of prayer without ceasing was to also take time to be quiet before the Lord, and listen! </p>
