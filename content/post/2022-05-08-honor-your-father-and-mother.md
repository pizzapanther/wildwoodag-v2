<p data-block-key="3byca">Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you. Ex. 20:12 </p><p data-block-key="5dvut">There are many ways to show HONOR! One way that we do this is by setting aside a special day, once a year: called Mother’s Day. My prayer is that every mother in this congregation be blessed and honored today! </p><p data-block-key="efkvj"> </p><p data-block-key="bcibh">If life has taught me anything, it is that we cannot take tomorrow for granted! Therefore, don’t just honor your mother today, but look for opportunities every day! Take advantage of the time, you will never regret it! </p>
