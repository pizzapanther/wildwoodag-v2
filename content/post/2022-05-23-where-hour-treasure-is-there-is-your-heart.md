<p data-block-key="ajed2">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. NKJV Matthew 6:21</p><p data-block-key="6jl55">On Wednesdays we are studying the Seven Deadly Sins; and last week it was the sin of Greed. How easy it is to trust money and forget about the blessings of God!</p><p data-block-key="fp307">Something that serves as a good reminder in avoiding the sin of greed is to remember that there are things better than money! Good health is better! A clear conscience is better! A cultivated, moral intelligence is better! A happy home is better! It is possible to be happy without money; but without these money just becomes deceitful.</p><p data-block-key="8m6i2">Lord, help us learn to be content, walk honorably and keep a clear conscience. </p>
