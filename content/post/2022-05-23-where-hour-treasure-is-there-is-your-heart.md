For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. NKJV Matthew 6:21

On Wednesdays we are studying the Seven Deadly Sins; and last week it was the sin of Greed. How easy it is to trust money and forget about the blessings of God!

Something that serves as a good reminder in avoiding the sin of greed is to remember that there are things better than money! Good health is better! A clear conscience is better! A cultivated, moral intelligence is better! A happy home is better! It is possible to be happy without money; but without these money just becomes deceitful.

Lord, help us learn to be content, walk honorably and keep a clear conscience.
