<p>when pride comes, then comes shame; but with the humble is wisdom. Proverbs 11:2</p><p>John Milton, in his Christian Classic PARADISE LOST, writes of Satan “Better to reign in hell then serve in heaven.” This statement is the personification of pride!</p><p>If you want to try and do things on your own, God will let you. You won’t enjoy it much, but maybe we can sell popcorn.</p><p>If you understand HUMILITY; you can say “Lord, less of me and more of You, please.”</p>
