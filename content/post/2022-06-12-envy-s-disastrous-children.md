Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy…   1 Corinthians 14:4

The fourth of the seven deadly sins: ENVY has some disastrous children, like anger and murder. Just consider Cain and Abel in Genesis 4.

Proverbs 14:30 says that “envy is rottenness to the bones.” Wow! What a warning!

Proverbs 3:31 says “Do not envy the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.”
