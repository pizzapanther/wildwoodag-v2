So we built the wall,â€¦for the people had a mind to work. Nehemiah 4:6

Whether we seal a parking lot, paint a fireside room, add a bathroom to the fellowship hall or refurbish the foyer, it all is a work of the people of the church. Prayer and giving and encouraging as well as putting your hands to the actual work is team work! And each team member is appreciated so much. Thank you!

May our work glorify the Lord and serve as a refreshing, warm welcome to those visiting and looking for a place to worship!
