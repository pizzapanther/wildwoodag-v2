<p>Matthew 8:24 - And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.</p><p>There are many things that catch us by surprise, they happen suddenly or are just unexpected. The game of baseball changed like that, and specifically, in 1863, the ‘curve ball’ was added to the game. What a surprise it must have been.  Kind of like some of the curves life throws at us today. </p><p>If you want to stay in the game, you learn to deal with the curve balls.</p>
