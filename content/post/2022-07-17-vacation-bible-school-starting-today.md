But Jesus said, &quot;let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.&quot; Matthew 19:14

This Sunday afternoon we are starting our VBS - Vacation Bible School! One of the best ways you can help us now is in prayer!

The goal is simple: minister to children in the community, and build a relationship with their parents. Pray with us for a harvest of young souls!
