Oh, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! Romans 7:24-25

No one would question the fact that the Apostle Paul was a mature believer in Christ. Still, his testimony about life and struggles was extremely transparent! He never pretended to be the super spiritual “I never have any trials” kinda guy. He was real! What’s more, he understood that our true strength comes from the Lord Jesus Christ!

We have been given power over sin, and we should take every advantage of it!
