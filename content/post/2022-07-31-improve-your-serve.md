<p data-block-key="jl19f">Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve… Matt. 20:28 </p><p data-block-key="1u9jj">You will not IMPROVE your “serve” by  making excuses or avoiding opportunities to serve others. These all served while others might have used their excuse not to: Abraham was old, but served. Joseph was abused, but served. Moses stuttered, but served. Gideon was afraid, but served. Peter had a temper, but served. Martha worried a lot, but served. Do you get the idea?</p><p data-block-key="1o8qm">We can all improve our ‘serve’! Let’s do it today! </p>
