But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 14) But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. 2 Tim. 3:13-14

The Apostle Paul, mentoring Timothy, is speaking to him and encouraging him to continue in what he has learned. Remembering that Paul said &quot;follow me as I follow Christ.&quot;

That is what we must do! We move forward and set an example that will embolden those who watch our lives. Thatâ€™s what our faith must be!
