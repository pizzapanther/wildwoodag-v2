<p>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11</p><p>1972-2022</p><p>Our reflection on this observance of 50 years is one that looks back with thankfulness and looks forward with hope! Thankful for the original vision to plant a church in the Canyon Lake area, and thankful for pastors who kept the vision going. Hopeful to continue with the vision: the Great Commission! </p><p>Indeed, we have a history and a future! May we embrace our future with everything in us, work to complete the Great Commission; and when it’s all said and done, know that we “left it all on the field”, that we gave our all to His work; and may God be glorified!</p>
