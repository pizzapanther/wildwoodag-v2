<p>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; before you were born, I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah 14-5</p><p><b>Additional Reflection 1972-2022</b></p><p>In the video Brother Summers sent us, he mentioned that the district inaugurated this church in August of 1972. </p><p>It was that summer, in a children’s home in San Antonio, Texas, that I knelt beside a baseball field and gave my heart to the Lord. Forty-eight years before He would call me to continue the work started here that day and serve this church. That’s our God!</p>
