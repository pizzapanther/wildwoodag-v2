But the wisdom that is from above is…  James 3:17(a)

When Solomon prayed to God, the Lord responded, “What shall I give you?” Wisely, Solomon asked for wisdom!  1 King 3:5

The Lord reminds us that if we lack wisdom; all we need to do is ask Him, and He will give it to us. Solomon was wise enough to ask? May we be just as wise: Lord, help us!
