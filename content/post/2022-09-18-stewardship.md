Moreover, it is required in stewards that one be found faithful. 1 Cor. 4:2

Our children grew up in Central Africa, among the Bantu tribal family. They have a proverb that says, “When there is more than enough, more than enough is wasted.”

This proverb recognizes that there is a need for stewardship; a need to be faithful with what one has been given! Indeed, this is what the Lord asks from us, that having knowledge of the principles of tithes and offerings, that we put them into practice.
