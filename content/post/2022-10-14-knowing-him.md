You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Psalm 23:5

The fifth verse of best-known Psalm in the world reminds us that God is the One who prepares for us! Like sheep, we “go astray” and like sheep we tend to consume everything, even if it is harmful. Yes, the enemy may be close, still our task is to stay even closer to Christ, where we find refuge and safety!

Remember that our cups will never be full and running over outside of our relationship with Christ. There is no substitute for KNOWING Him!
