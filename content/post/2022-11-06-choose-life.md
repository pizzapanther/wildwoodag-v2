Satan speaking to Christ says, “All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.” Matthew 4:9

Here we find the one who tried to overthrow the Creator of the Universe, and after his fall he made the decision, as John Milton writes: “Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.”

Truth be told, Satan had nothing to offer Christ that was of any value in eternity, and nor does he possess anything that will edify your life!

The choice is yours, choose life!
