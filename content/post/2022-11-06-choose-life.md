<p data-block-key="201ts">Satan speaking to Christ says, “All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.” Matthew 4:9 </p><p data-block-key="5c7c1">Here we find the one who tried to overthrow the Creator of the Universe, and after his fall he made the decision, as John Milton writes: “Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.”</p><p data-block-key="a09s6">Truth be told, Satan had nothing to offer Christ that was of any value in eternity, and nor does he possess anything that will edify your life!</p><p data-block-key="8togg">The choice is yours, choose life!</p>
