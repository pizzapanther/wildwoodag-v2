But those who wait on the Lordâ€‹ shall renew their strength; they mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint. Isaiah 40:31

When you understand the value of being in His presence, you will want to wait more and more on the Lord! A consistent prayer life is extremely valuable. Learn to linger in His presence!

Jesus asked His inner circle if they could not wait an hour? They were supposed to be praying, but they were asleep. Today, many are sleeping who need to be praying!
