<i>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights… James 1:17</i>

RAPPER POEM:<br/>Shop till you drop, if you’re in the mood;<br/>Remember your manners, be a cool dude.<br/>Have fun buying gifts, for friends and family; remember the season, and keep it merrily.<br/>Nothing like the moment, when you begin to feel; the spirit of the season, it all becomes surreal.<br/>It’s not about the gifts, and it’s not about the giving; but the One who gave THE GIFT, who makes it all worth living!
