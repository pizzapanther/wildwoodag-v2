<p>…wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying ‘Where is He’? Matthew 2:1-2 </p><p>From that day until now, wise men continue to ask ‘where is He’? Wise men still seek Him! And He can and will be found by those who truly seek Him with a whole heart! </p><p>He reveals Himself to us in so many ways! In the heavens – the many stars and our universe! In life – new born babies! In the beauty around us – creation is a demonstration of his handiwork that no one can deny any more than one would say that a Coocoo clock evolved from a tree: No, it had a creator, just as we do. </p>
