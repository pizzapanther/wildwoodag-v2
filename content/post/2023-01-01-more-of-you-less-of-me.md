He must increase, but I must decrease. John 3:30

In this new year, we have a great opportunity to leave behind the garbage (the things that weigh us down) in the past. John the Baptist expressed it a lot like this: “He must increase, but I must decrease.”

Another way of saying it that there should be more of Jesus in my life, and less of me!

Glen Campbell expressed it well in his song Less of Me, writing “Let me be a little meeker with the brother who is weaker, think a little more of others and a little less of me.”
