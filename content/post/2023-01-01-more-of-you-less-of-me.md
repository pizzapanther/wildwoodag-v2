<p>He must increase, but I must decrease. John 3:30</p><p>In this new year, we have a great opportunity to leave behind the garbage (the things that weigh us down) in the past. John the Baptist expressed it a lot like this: “He must increase, but I must decrease.”  </p><p>Another way of saying it that there should be more of Jesus in my life, and less of me! </p><p>Glen Campbell expressed it well in his song Less of Me, writing “Let me be a little meeker with the brother who is weaker, think a little more of others and a little less of me.”</p>
