The prayer of a person living right with God is something powerful to be reckoned with. The Message, James 5:16

It is time for the people of God to return to being people of prayer! Just as we have read above, “prayer is something powerful to be reckoned with”!

“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened.” Matthew 7:7

You might ask: What is the secret? It is simple: you are the one going to the gates of heaven asking, seeking and knocking.
