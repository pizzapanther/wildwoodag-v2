<p data-block-key="irf5s">Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said unto Him, ‘Lord, teach us to prayer, as John also taught his disciples.’ Luke 11:1</p><p data-block-key="cs6jn">We find the disciples were watching Jesus and they had come to realize that the reason for His continued power was prayer! So, they ask Him to teach them.</p><p data-block-key="1asgr">Prayer is NO mystery! It is conversation with God. Talk with Him like you would speak with a friend you loved! The more time you spend with Him in prayer, the more your spiritual strength will increase. </p>
