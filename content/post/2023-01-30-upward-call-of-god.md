I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.  Philippians 3:14

History seems to show us that no true revival ever happened simply because people sought revival. It took place when people sought Him! Sometimes we think we can announce a revival, and we can have ‘revival services’, but it will fall short.

Let us seek the Reviver, not just revival! Let us seek a closer walk with Him; let’s seek intimacy with the Almighty! And let us say “less of me and more of Him”.
