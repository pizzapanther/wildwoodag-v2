The Lord has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.  2 Sam. 6:12

The ark of the covenant (or testimony) represented the presence of the Lord! God said “You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark,… And there I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the Testimony.” Ex. 25:21-22. In the Tabernacle, the ark was to be kept inside the “Holy of Holies” or the most holy place.

On several occasions when the ark was moved, people died because of their failure to properly handle and reverence the presence and holiness of God!

We need; indeed, we must learn to handle the holy things of God with greater awe, reverence and sensitivity! The veil has been removed and we have direct access with The Trinity: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit! Let us seek the manifest glory of God with awe and respect that demonstrates the true fear of the Lord!
