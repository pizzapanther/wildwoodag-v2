<p data-block-key="ntqk9">But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. Hebrews 9:11-12 </p><p data-block-key="4rb85">The top of the Ark of Covenant was called the Mercy Seat. It was more like a covering or a lid for the Ark on which the cherubim spread their wings covering it all. There was a veil (a thick drape), that separated the area where the Ark was; it was called the Holy of Holies.</p><p data-block-key="2pveb">When Christ went to the cross, taking all our sins, He paid the price with His own blood. It was at that time that the veil was torn in two, symbolic of the access we received to &quot;meet with God&quot; (Ex. 25:22) directly, ourselves. No more veil!</p><p data-block-key="cvgpa">Provision for you to have the sweetest communion with your Creator has been made available to you. What are you going to do with it?</p>
