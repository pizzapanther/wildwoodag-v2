Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord. 7 And he said to the people, “Proceed, and march around the city, and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the Lord.” 8 So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Lord advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them. 9 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets. 10 Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.” 11 So he had the ark of the Lord circle the city, going around it once. Then they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.” Joshua 6:6-11

The children of Israel carried the Ark of the Covenant into battle often, as the Lord directed them. Remember that it was the top of the Ark, the Mercy Seat (covering) where the Lord said He would meet with His servants. The Ark represented the presence of the Lord going with them into battle. Today, the presence of the Lord can be in our hearts and lives, going with us to face any battle we might have on any given day.  Don’t go without Him!
