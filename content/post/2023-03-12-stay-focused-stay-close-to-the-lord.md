Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down… 33 And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood,…    1 Kings 18:30,33

There are three lessons to be learned from this passage:

<ol><li>Elijah realized the altar needed repair. Recognizing the condition of your altar is crucial!</li><li>The prophet immediately began repairs. Don’t put this off until tomorrow, or another day.</li><li>He used the altar after repairing it. Take a quiet moment and use your altar (your quiet time with the Lord).   </li></ol>Remember to put your eyes on the Lord! Stay focused and stay close to the Lord. The signs of the times are everywhere!
