<p data-block-key="jnrys">Nothing is worth holding on to so hard that you can’t hold Him.   Tommy Tenney</p><p data-block-key="fmiaj">Do not love the world or the things in the world…  1 John 2:15</p><p data-block-key="4lq3m">It is such a strange word: THINGS! The ‘things’ in the world. The Message says “the world’s goods”. The history of storage units and mini-storage facilities in the US is interesting and startling at the same time. It is evidence of the fact that we have a difficult time letting go of our ‘things’, the world’s goods!  </p><p data-block-key="ftnfi">Let us take care that we do not hold so tightly to something that we are unable to hold what is most important: Christ! Revelation 3:11 says “…hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.”  </p>
