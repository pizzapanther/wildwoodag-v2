Then it shall come to pass, because you listen to these judgments, and keep and do them, that the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers. Deuteronomy 7:12

When we listen to the Lord and walk in obedience to His Word, we are rewarded with the blessings that come through a covenant fellowship. You might know that if we choose not to listen and walk in disobedience, we can expect the opposite.

I have said it before, but it is worth repeating: when we pray (talk with God), we would be better off shutting our mouths and listening rather than asking and complaining without end. LISTEN! Listen to Him, to His still small voice! And remember that with the same letters used to spell the word LISTEN, we may spell the word SILENT.

Be SILENT before the Lord, and LISTEN!
