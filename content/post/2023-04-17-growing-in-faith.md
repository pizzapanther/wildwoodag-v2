<p data-block-key="1rudt">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  Hebrews 11:1</p><p data-block-key="ftgqf">Years ago, I penned these words: </p><p data-block-key="c1c80">“With an open heart<br/>I receive Your Word;<br/>and with an open mind<br/>I respond.</p><p data-block-key="18a3t">Each day Your letters become<br/>real to me; how I’ve grown<br/>beyond.</p><p data-block-key="11kc4">Beyond my own strength,<br/>past my own limits;<br/>with the love and understanding<br/>that faith in You permits.”</p><p data-block-key="8l9gj">M.G. Baumgartner, 1984</p><p data-block-key="fn3io">Growing in faith with the Lord means that you will find yourself in a different place next week, next month and next year.</p>
