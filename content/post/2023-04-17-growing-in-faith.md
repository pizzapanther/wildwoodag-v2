<p>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  Hebrews 11:1</p><p>Years ago, I penned these words: </p><p>“With an open heart<br/>I receive Your Word;<br/>and with an open mind<br/>I respond.</p><p>Each day Your letters become<br/>real to me; how I’ve grown<br/>beyond.</p><p>Beyond my own strength,<br/>past my own limits;<br/>with the love and understanding<br/>that faith in You permits.”</p><p>M.G. Baumgartner, 1984</p><p>Growing in faith with the Lord means that you will find yourself in a different place next week, next month and next year.</p>
