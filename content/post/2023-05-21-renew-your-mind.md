<p data-block-key="9t4lr">Romans 12:1 says, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</p><p data-block-key="1gbq8">The way in which the Lord desires us to serve is not as dead sacrifices, but rather as living!  “To live is Christ!”  In order to accomplish that goal, we must avoid being conformed to this world! In Christ, the Lamb of God, we are able to be transformed – a true renewal of our minds!</p>
