Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember? Mark 8:18

Speaking of military veterans, purple heart recipient H.W. Osterkamp said, “All gave some, and some gave all.” In our congregation are many veterans, some who served during peace time and some who serve during a war; I am one of them. Yet we all came home. Today, we remember those who gave all for our freedoms, but they did not return home!  This is why we celebrate Memorial Day!

Yet, there is Another, who is closer than a brother, He paid it all for our salvation, healing, and freedom: may we remember forever!
