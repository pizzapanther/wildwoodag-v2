20) Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the open squares. 21) She cries out in the chief concourses, at the openings of the gates in the city She speaks her words: 22) “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge. 23) Turn at my rebuke; surely, I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.” Proverbs 1:20-23

We often fall into foolish behavior and actions when we fail to listen to Wisdom! Furthermore, it is not enough to hear it, we must also act upon it. Prudence is taking wisdom and applying it to practical matters, to everyday living. James 1:5 says, “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God…” What are you waiting for?
