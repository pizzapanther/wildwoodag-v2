For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, And His ears are open to their prayers; But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.  1 Peter 3:12

When we lift up our voices in prayer to the Lord, His Word tells us that He sees and hears! God is listening to you!

We are taking June 5-July 4 to pray for America! And she needs prayer! Please, make it a point to pray for the various US Missions departments, as well as the need listed for on the date in the prayer guide.

Today we are to pray for discernment as spiritual warfare intensifies.
