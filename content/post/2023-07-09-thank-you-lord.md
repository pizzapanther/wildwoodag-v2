Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. Psalms 107:1

This verse is repeated several times in Psalms 107, in order to add emphasis, even a response from the people to remember to give thanks!

We need to be reminded! God wants us to remember to give thanks because that is how He created us. And we are the ones who benefit when we show our gratitude. Quite literally, when you are too blessed to be stressed, and you speak it; you acknowledge it to the Lord and others, you actually rest better and have less stress, according to scientific studies about anxiety and gratefulness.

So, say it with me, “Thank you Lord!”
