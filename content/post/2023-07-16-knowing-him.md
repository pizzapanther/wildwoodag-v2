That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, 11. if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. Philippians 3:10-11

When I consider a passage that should be considered to meditate on and memorize, these verses make the list!

Knowing Him is our highest goal! Not the simple ‘head knowledge’, but the heart knowledge of relationship. To know about the Lord, yet not know Him as your personal Lord and Savior is exactly how people miss heaven! Think about it!
