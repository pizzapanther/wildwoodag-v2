Let the priests, who minister to the Lord, Weep between the porch and the altar; Let them say, “Spare Your people, Oh Lord,…Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’ ” Joel 2:17

Perhaps the assignment I take the most serious and likely the one that weighs on my heart the most is that of crying out to God for the people. He has put under my shepherd’s staff: the weep between the porch and the altar… saying spare Your people, oh Lord is a high calling!

No, I am not going to tell you what you ‘want’ to hear; but I will faithfully speak God’s Word to you, and pray for you often; that’s a pastor’s heart.
