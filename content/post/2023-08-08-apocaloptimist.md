<p data-block-key="piy6b">For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.</p><p data-block-key="25q4c">1 Thessalonians 4:16</p><p data-block-key="bgll6">The other day I came across the funniest of words: APOCALOPTIMIST. A made-up word from Apocalypse and Optimist. The definition provided was “Someone who knows that the world is going towards hell and destruction, but still thinks it will turn out okay.”</p><p data-block-key="41b2c">For those who truly walk in Christ, who live in the Spirit, it will end well. For us, the absence from the body is to be present with the Lord. Now, for those who are not in Christ, not living right, not walking in the Spirit, all the wishful thinking in the world will not make it end well. Take a quiet moment and think on this!</p>
