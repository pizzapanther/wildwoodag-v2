<p data-block-key="5romw">I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge and discretion. 13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverse mouth I hate. 14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, I have strength. 15 By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice. 16 By me princes rule, and nobles, all the judges of the earth. 17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, enduring riches and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold, and my revenue than choice silver.</p><p data-block-key="6pank">Proverbs 8:12-19</p><p data-block-key="blvt2">The daily devotional is of great value when you consider that we can discover the gold and silver of wisdom, and the Lord offers us the possibility of taking that wisdom and applying it to our lives (that is prudence).</p>
