Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God,… Romans 13:1

There are, in fact, three institutions of God: the family, the church and government.

Today is Constitution Day – 17 Sept. 1787

In our Preamble to the Constitution it says,

"We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
