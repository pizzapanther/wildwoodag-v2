Matthew 5:6 says, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.

Bread is mentioned 360 times in the Bible! There’s a reason!

We make the decision to have fresh bread in our homes! And we make the decision to have fresh bread in our church! The presence of the Lord comes because He is welcome here and because we hunger for righteousness!

I have a recipe here for bread. However, just possessing the recipe does not make the bread. No program or prayer meeting alone will usher in the presence of God for us, we must seek His face! We must cry out to Him!
