Jesus said to them, "I Am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger,… John 6:35

Remember! Bread is mentioned 360 times in the Bible! There’s a reason!

That "showbread" of the Old Covenant represented the presence of God. Which helps us understand what Christ meant when He said, "I AM the bread of life"! Who wants stale bread? No one! Fresh bread – a fresh relationship with our Lord, that is what is needed in our lives. Do not settle for anything less than fresh bread.
