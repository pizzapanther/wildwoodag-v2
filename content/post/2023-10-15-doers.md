But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. James 1:22

There is a choice to be made here. Prayerfully we won't choose to have a full head and an empty heart; but often that's what we do.

All the knowledge of God in the world won't save you! You must KNOW Him,… like the difference between the Spanish verbs SABER – (to know of) & CONOCER – (to personally know)!
