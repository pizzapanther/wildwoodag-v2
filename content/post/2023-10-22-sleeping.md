Watch therefore,… lest coming suddenly, He find you sleeping. Mark 13:35-36

The words of the song "While You Were Sleeping" are sobering! The first verse sings "Oh little town of Bethlehem, looks like another silent night; above your deep and dreamless sleep a giant star light up the sky; and while you're lying in the dark, there shines an everlasting light,… for the King has left His throne and is sleeping in a manager tonight,… Oh Bethlehem, what you have missed while you were sleeping? For became a man and stepped into your world today; oh Bethlehem, you will go down in history as a city with no room for its King,… while you were sleeping…" The final chorus says, "America, what will we miss while we are sleeping? Will Jesus come again and leave us slumbering where we lay? America, will we go down in history, as a nation with no room for its King? Will we be sleeping?
