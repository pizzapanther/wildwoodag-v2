But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in youâ€¦ 1 Peter 3:15

Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, "Your life as a Christian should make non-believers question their disbelief in God.""

How do we accomplish this? First, by keeping our mouth shut and working to be SALT & LIGHT; and then, when they notice that, they will ask us about the difference they see. Second, we should be ready to give them an answer for what they see, an answer for the hope that is in us!
