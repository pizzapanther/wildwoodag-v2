â€œI heard the bells on Christmas Day<br>
Their old, familiar carols play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wild and sweet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words repeat<br>
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!<br>

And thought how, as the day had come,<br>
The belfries of all Christendom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rolled along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unbroken song<br>
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!<br>

Till ringing, singing on its way,<br>
The world revolved from night to day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice, a chime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chant sublime<br>
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!<br>

And in despair I bowed my head;<br>
"There is no peace on earth," I said;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For hate is strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mocks the song<br>
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!"<br>

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:<br>
"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wrong shall fail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right prevail,<br>
With peace on earth, good-will to men."

H.W. Longfellow
