Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. Matthew 6:20

Another version, The Message, says, "Stockpile treasure in heavenâ€¦"

This is what we are doing when we tithe (give 10%), when we give an offering, when we support Missions: we are stockpiling those spiritual treasures that cannot be lost! Our missions Sunday with the friendly competition for BGMC is an excellent example.

My heart is full as a Pastor when I see the congregational response in giving, knowing that on the one hand, we will have treasure in heaven, and on the other hand we are fulfilling the Great Commission.

Today, as we celebrate the sanctity of life, we are forming new partnerships here in our county, and lives will literally be saved! What a great treasure!
