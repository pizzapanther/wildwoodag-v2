And He changes the times and the seasons; Daniel 2:21

## Change

“We like our routine, that is true.
Who cares if it’s boring or 
makes us blue.
Routine means one thing; we like a lot:
We don’t have to change, ah, 
the same ‘old spot’.
But when it’s time to go, 
to make a change,
Trust the One above, ‘cause it’s
His grand stage.”

*Mark Gerard*
