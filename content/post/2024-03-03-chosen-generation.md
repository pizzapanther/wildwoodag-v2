You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special peopleâ€¦  1 Peter 2:9

Sarah, our daughter, struggled with the idea of a "calling". She believed that because we were missionaries and ministers, our expectations for her were that she do the same. So, she set out to try and accomplish that. In time we were able to help her see that "the priesthood of all believers" is lived out by each of us being the best citizen and worker, at whatever we do, and do it as unto the Lord! Often we just say: be salt and light!
