But he (The angel) said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him." Mark 16:6

Recently I was at a minister’s conference where I had the opportunity to hear Mark Batterson speak. He ministers in a gentle, humble way that speaks to your soul. Knowing that I was going to hear him speak, I bought his most recent book intending to have him sign it and add it to my small collection of signed books.

After the service my son and I went to the VIP room certain that we would see him there and get the book signed then. I waited, and waited until I finally asked someone who said that he was last seen at the altar praying with ministers. I was looking for him in the VIP room, but he was to be found praying at the altar for other ministers. That’s a true VIP Altar.

Likewise, when we seek the Lord with all our heart, we will find Him; and at the altar is a great place to look. The beauty of it all is that He is also looking for us.
