You shall have honest scales, honest weights… Lev. 19:36

In 1978, in Billy Joel’s song “Honesty” he writes, ♫“Honesty is such a lonely word; everyone is so untrue!♫ Honesty is hardly even heard; and mostly what I need from you!”♫

If you think about the message, God could easily ask His heavenly choir to sing this chorus! He wants us to be honest with Him and with ourselves!
