Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,
But a body You have prepared for Me. 6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure. 7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come—
In the volume of the book it is written of Me—
To do Your will, O God.’ ” 8 Previously saying, “Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin You did not desire, nor had pleasure in them” (which are offered according to the law), 9 then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will, Oh God.” He takes away the first that He may establish the second. 10 By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. Heb.10:5-10

Christ, the Lamb of God, was the ultimate, perfect sacrifice for our sins. Truthfully, He paid a debt He did not owe, we owed a debt we could not pay. That is what Jesus did for you and me!
