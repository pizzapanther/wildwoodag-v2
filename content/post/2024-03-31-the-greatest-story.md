We call it "Good Friday", yet the truth is, it was a dark day. Christ was crucified, He died and was buried. His disciples were confused and scattered for a while. But Sunday… yes Sunday was on the way!

The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the GREATEST story ever told, and it is an accurate account of the life, death, burial and resurrection of the person of Jesus, the Son of God. An honest evaluation of the evidence of Christ on this earth must be considered before one says, “He didn’t exist”. 

St. Augustine said, "He who denies the existence of God, has some reason for wishing that God did not exist."

If you are a doubting Thomas, may I suggest the writings of Lee Strobel: [The Case for A Creator](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Creator-Lee-Strobel/dp/0310242096) and [The Case for Christ](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Christ-Revised-Updated-Investigation/dp/B01M1UOEV4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&sr=1-1).
