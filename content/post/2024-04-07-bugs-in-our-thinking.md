Is anything too hard for the Lord?” Genesis 18:14

This is the answer that God gave to Abraham and Sarah after Sarah laughed about having a baby.

Paul Bailey brought the men’s devotional yesterday and ‘hit the ball out of the park’. One thing in particular caught my attention, he called it “The Bugs in our Thinking” (from the idea of ‘working the bug’s out). One item on Paul’s list was this:

*I’M TOO OLD*

He used the example of Abraham and Sarah, but also mentioned that the Hebrew language has no word for "retired". While he was teaching, I heard Wayne & Julie Clark in my head saying, "No coasting to the finish line."

It's time to work out the bugs in our thinking!
