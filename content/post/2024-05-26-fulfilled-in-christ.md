And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. Luke 24:27

It is possible that in the Believer’s University Christ share this verse with them, “In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,…” Genesis 22:18. Perhaps He mentioned Psalm 22:1 “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” The words He spoke on the cross! He just might have spoke about Psalm 110:1 “The Lord said to My Lord, ‘Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool.” This verse is quoted seven times in the New Testament! 

It is time to go back to the Believer’s University and study to show ourselves approved. Missionary Donald Stamps, who wrote the study notes for the Fire Bible lists hundreds of Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Christ.
