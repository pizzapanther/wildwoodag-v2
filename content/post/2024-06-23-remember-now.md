Remember your Creator before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the well. Ecclesiastes 12:7

If I were to paraphrase this, I would say, “You better remember God while there is breath in your lungs.” Matthew Henry refers to the ‘silver cord’ as that which binds the soul and body.  The Message says, “before the silver cord of life snaps.”

This passage is communicating to us, in a poetic manner, that life has an end, and before we get there it is best to remember the Lord! Not on your death bed, nor with your last dying breath. Remember Him now and take the steps necessary to have peace with Christ. He is, after all, our Peace.
