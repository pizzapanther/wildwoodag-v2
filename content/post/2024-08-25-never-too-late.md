Mary…fell down at His feet, saying, ‘Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. John 11:32

When Jesus arrived in Bethany, the home of Lazarus, Mary and Martha, the women greeted Him, but their words were sharp.

Mark Batterson asks, “Is it just me, or does that sound passive aggressive? It’s almost like they were saying, ‘It’s not Your fault, but it is, but it isn’t, but it is.’ Their words were born of a deep-seated awareness that Jesus could have kept Lazarus from dying.”

The women believed that Jesus was four days late. What we need to realize is that nothing is over until He says it’s over! It was during this time that we learn of the shortest verse in the bible: “Jesus wept.” Batterson said, “When you give someone a second chance, it resurrects faith, hope, and love.” Christ gave that to Lazarus, Mary, and Martha.
