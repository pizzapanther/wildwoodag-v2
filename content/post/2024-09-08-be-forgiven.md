There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. Romans 8:1

Mark Batterson says, “We often think of the Greatest Commandment as two-dimensional: love God and love others. But there is a third dimension: love yourself. It is hard to love others when you don’t love yourself. How do you love yourself? You let God love you. You let God forgive you. And you accept His assessment of who you are.”

There is a distinction to be made: condemnation is guilt over confessed sin, and it comes from the Enemy. Conviction is guilt over unconfessed sin, and it comes from the Holy Spirit. 

In order to walk in forgiveness and live in the light of eternity, you must forgive yourself so that you will be able to forgive others, even as Christ has forgiven you. Allow the conviction of the Holy Spirit to motivate you to put your sins under the blood: God is waiting for you to confess, turn away from the sin, and be forgiven.
