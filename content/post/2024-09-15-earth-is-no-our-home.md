The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God."" Isaiah 40:3

Last week I shared a message about Comfort for God’s People. I noted that the above passage was fulfilled in Matthew 3:3, by John the Baptist: the one who called the people to repentance, the one who actually prepared the way for Jesus. 

In moments like these, there are choices to be made, remember? Like the word ‘hate’ has four letters, but so does ‘love’. The goal of John the Baptist was to point us to Christ. The goal of Jesus was to show us how to get home. We are citizens of heaven: this earth is not our home!
