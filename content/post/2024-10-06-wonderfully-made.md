The heavens declare the glory of god; and the firmament shows His handiwork. Psalm 19:1

In 1885 Wilson Bentley took a picture, called a photomicrograph of a snowflake. He said, “Under the microscope, I found that snowflakes were miracles of beauty.” He was the first to realize that each one is not only a masterpiece, but unique in design – no two snowflakes are the same. His photography under the microscope was his “magnum opus” or his greatest work. 

You know what is more amazing and fascinating to me: you and I, for we are ‘fearfully and wonderfully made’ and more unique than the most beautiful snowflake.

Give that some thought as you praise the Lord.
