Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. Revelation 3:10

When commenting on this verse, Matthew Henry said, “By keeping the gospel they are prepared for the trial, and the same divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace will make them faithful in times of persecution.”

Oh Lord, let that be us! Fruitful in times of peace and faithful in times of persecution!
