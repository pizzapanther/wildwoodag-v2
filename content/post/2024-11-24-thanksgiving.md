And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God… Luke 17:15

You might know this story. There were ten men with leprosy and Christ healed them. However, only one returned to thank the Lord.

Mark Batterson says, “All ten were healed of their physical ailment, but only one of them was healed of something much worse – ingratitude. It was that one leper who doubled back to Jesus, fell at His feet, and said thanks!” 

My prayer is: Heal me like that, Lord!
