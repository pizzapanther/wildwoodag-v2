Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. Genesis 1:31

In this season of thankfulness, when is the last time you enjoy a sun rise or sun set? When is the last time you looked at the stars? When was the last time you quieted your mind and took some time to enjoy with Him alone?

We demonstrate gratitude by taking time to enjoy what He has created for us, what He has given us. Be thankful and donâ€™t waste it!
