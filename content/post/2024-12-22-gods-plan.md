And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered…so all went to be registered, everyone to his own city. Joseph also went up…to Bethlehem… Luke 2:1-4

When we continue to read the story in Luke, we find that upon arrival in Bethlehem, Joseph found no proper place to stay. The entire Christmas story teaches us an important lesson: All the plans of God are not made known to us! Mary was surprised, Joseph was surprised even more! Once they had accepted their roles in God’s plan, they found themselves traveling to the little town of Bethlehem where they literally found no room to stay in. You know that Joseph’s plan was a La Quinta or perhaps Bethlehem’s Inn & Suites; ah, but God’s plans. We are told to trust Him, and that’s what Joseph and Mary did.

Let us follow their example, though we do not know the plan, let us trust the One we know, trust Him.
