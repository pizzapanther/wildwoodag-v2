For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened. Mark 6:52

In this verse we are shown the truth about the miracle of the fish and loaves that Christ multiplied to feed five thousand. The disciples had not recognized just how miraculous it was; and on top of everything else, their hearts were hard! 

This is why they were overly amazed at Christ walking on the water and calming the storm in the previous verses!

You see, the Lord had blessed the fish and loaves, but the multiplication actually happened in their hands, as they distributed the portions. But hardened hearts are slow to see, and slower to understand.

While we say farewell to this year, and hello to a brand-new fresh year, let us draw closer to Him, let our hearts be tender and may we see and understand with spiritual eyes.
