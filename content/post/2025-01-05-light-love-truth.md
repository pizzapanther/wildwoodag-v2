One of my favorite poets wrote this…

“Our fathers to their graves have gone; their strife is past – their triumph won.

But sterner trials wait the race which rises in their honored place – a moral warfare with the crime, and folly of an evil time.

So let it be, in God’s own might, we gird us for the coming fight, and strong in Him whose cause is ours, in conflict with unholy powers.

We gasp the weapons He has given – The Light, the Truth, and Love of Heaven.”

John Greenleaf Whittier
