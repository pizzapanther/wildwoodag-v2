The Lord God has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary. He awakens me morning by morning, He awakens my ear to hear as the learned. Isaiah 50:4

If we are not careful, we can fall into the trap of ‘busyness’. It could be that we have put too much on our ‘plate of things to do’; it could be that our focus is wrong. As the saying goes, “your focus needs more focus.” Either way, we must hear a few words spoken in season. First, don’t lose heart. Second, wait on the Lord. And third, look to Jesus! Hebrews 12:2 says, “Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith…” Be sure and spend some private time with the Lord. And remember, if the solution does not include Christ, you still have a problem.
