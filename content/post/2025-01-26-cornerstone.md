His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope… 1 Peter 1:1. Coming to Him as to a living stone… 1 Peter 2:4

Those who walk in Christ understand clearly that we have hope because of Him. In fact, the Word says, “a living hope”. Later the Spirit speaks through Peter saying, “a living stone”, and we learn that He is the chief cornerstone and precious to us as believers.

Isn’t it interesting that this same cornerstone, Christ our Lord, is precious to us, but to those who are disobedient, those who reject Him, the cornerstone becomes a “stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.”

People always have a choice! I choose to walk in obedience with Him.
