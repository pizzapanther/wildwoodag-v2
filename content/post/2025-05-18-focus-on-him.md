One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple. Psalms 27:4

King David and the Apostle Paul had something in common, something that is fascinating: their focus on one thing!

But one thing I do... I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.  Philippians 3:13-14

The Apostle Paul and King David Loved the Lord! Both of them were vessels used of God, and both of them were imperfect individuals who picked themselves up out of the dirt, brushed the dust off, and strived to do better and live closer to the Lord. Neither the King nor the Apostle made excuses; rather they confessed and repented.

The Lord desires the same thing from you and me! A focus on one thing: Him. When our relationship with Him is right, every other interpersonal relationship falls into place.
