This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. You are My friends if you do whatever I command you. John 15:12-14 NKJV

We are “celebrating” a long weekend to remember the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for their country. When I consider that sacrifice, how great that love was, I am convinced that they were friends of the nation!

This Memorial Day, may we remember with honor and respect all those who gave their lives for freedom. And may we never forget that cost: freedom isn’t free.
