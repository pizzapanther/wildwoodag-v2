Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues. 1 Cor. 14:39

Here is how a former non-Pentecostal saw things, “The major premise is that pneumatology (things of the Spirit) must derive from Scripture. Meanwhile, the minor premise holds that the Spirit’s supernatural work ceased during the first century. From these points, Cessationists conclude that spiritual gifts are not for today, but with no compelling biblical evidence.” It is their own interpretation of God’s Word, but 2 Peter 1:20-21 says, “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.”

Pastor Chad Harvey said that when he read the Bible for himself, he found Pentecost. That was my experience as well, but I had the help of a young Pentecostal evangelist named Kelly.

1 Thessalonians 5:19 says, “Do not quench the Spirit.” Verse 20 continues, “Do not despise prophecies.”
