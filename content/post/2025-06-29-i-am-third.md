But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Matthew 6:33

The principle of “I am third” is an important guide for me. It reminds me of three things:

First, God must be first in my life. My relationship with Him must be a daily priority.

Next, others are second. Family, neighbors, spiritual family, you get it.

Finally, I am third. My focus is not on ‘self’. This is important if one desires to avoid being self-centered and self-absorbed. If you think about it, it is kind of like those two great commandments: to love God and love your neighbor.
