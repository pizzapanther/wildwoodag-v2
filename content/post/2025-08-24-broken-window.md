They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness. 2 Peter 2:15

It has been said many times:

"Sin will take you farther than you want to go, keep you longer than you want to stay, and cost you more than you want to pay. –"

Like the Broken Windows Theory, we learn quickly that seemingly little things that are not taken care of can cause huge problems! We cannot "toy" with sin! You might want to "play", but sin wants to DESTROY you. It will take you towards the pit of hell, it will keep you in bondage even when you want to go, and the cost will be unbearable. When you see the first ‘broken window’ fix it quickly, lest the enemy of our souls obtains a foot hold.
