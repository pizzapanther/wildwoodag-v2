The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23

The 7-ELEVEN convenience store in Sattler was just rebuilt from the ground up. Several days ago, they had a Grand Opening where they were giving away free food and drinks. A free coffee was one of the items given away, so naturally I had to stop and visit!

Did you know that God has free gifts every day, not just on Grand Openings?

Romans 6:23 says, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
