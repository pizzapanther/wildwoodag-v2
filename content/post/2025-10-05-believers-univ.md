These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so. Acts 17:11

There are some exciting changes that have taken place on Wednesday nights. We have launched The Believer’s University! Essentially, the teachings on Wednesday night are a rich study of classes offered by Global University, at the Institute level known as the Berean School of the Bible, named after the Acts 17:11 verse, the Bereans being more noble or fair-minded and searching the Scriptures. That is what The Believer’s University is all about. You can simply enjoy the wonderful teaching, or you can take the classes for college credit. Either way, you will be blessed!
