One of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray… Luke 11:1

When should you pray? Let me tell you, that there are two days when you cannot do a thing: tomorrow, because it has not arrived, and yesterday, because it is past. Again, I ask, when should you pray? There is only one answer: today! You need to focus on today.

If we are going to be “doers” of the Word, it must be today! And prayer is essential!
