In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory… John 1:1, 14

A school teacher asked her class to mention things associated with Christmas. The children began to respond with many answers: Santa Claus, reindeer, gifts, and then, a little girl spoke up saying, “The Birth of Jesus.” Oh no, replied the teacher quickly, that's not what we mean.

What do we mean? It is so easy to get caught up with the lights and gifts that we forget what it is about. The real Christmas story is this:

*The Word was made flesh!*

*The Word dwelt among us!*

*We beheld His glory! *
