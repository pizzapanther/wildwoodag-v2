They presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Matthew 2:11

These specific gifts carry meaning with them as well as value. It is possible that we do not have gold, but we can have a heart that like gold can be presented to Him. We might not have frankincense, but we can have an attitude that when it is right before God, it can be used to worship Him with a sweet-smelling aroma. And we might not have myrrh, but we have the opportunity to die to self, and like myrrh change the atmosphere of death into a positive, sweet-smelling, preserving experience.
