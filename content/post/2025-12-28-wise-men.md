Behold, wise men from the East came…They presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Matthew 2:1,11

There are many people that are not aware that much of the Latino world celebrates their gift giving, not on the 25th of December, but on the 6th of January, known as Three Kings Day. The idea is that the three Wise men brought gifts to Jesus, not at the manger, but after the census, when other travelers had gone home, they came to the house where the family had moved to from the stable. There they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. From now until the 6th of January, I wish you a Happy Three Kings Day.
