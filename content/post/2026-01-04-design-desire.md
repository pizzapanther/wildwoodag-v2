I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly. John 10:10

People often read the book of Job and they are confused. Yet, Bill Johnson says, “the story of Job is about holding to our faith in the midst of trials and seeing God restore everything brilliantly.”

The story we really need to follow is the story of Jesus! His design and desire for us is life abundantly and “peace and goodwill toward men.” Luke 2:14
